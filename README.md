## Built With

  

  
  

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) - Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on the V8 engine. It allows developers to use JavaScript to build server-side applications, which was traditionally done with languages like Java, Python, and Ruby [1].
  

* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) - Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs. It provides a range of features and tools for creating robust and scalable web applications quickly and easily. Express.js is built on top of Node.js and provides a simple and intuitive API for handling HTTP requests and responses, routing, middleware, and more [2].

* [NanoID](https://github.com/ai/nanoid#readme) - `nanoid` is a small, fast, and secure library for generating unique IDs in Node.js. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, and it uses the crypto library to generate random IDs that are highly unlikely to collide [3].
